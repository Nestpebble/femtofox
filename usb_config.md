## USB Configuration Tool
To configure some Femtofox settings such as wifi, you can insert a USB flash drive containing a configuration file. On boot, the system will automatically recognize, mount and implement the settings you specify. The tool can also be run from the `femto-config` tool, in the `Utilities` menu.

Configurable settings are:
 - Wifi SSID
 - Wifi PSK (password)
 - Wifi country
 - Timezone
 - Meshtastic:
     - LoRa radio model
	 - [URL](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/python/cli/#--seturl-seturl) (used to configure LoRa settings and channels)
	 - Security: Add Admin Key
	 - Security: Clear Admin Key List
	 - Security: [Legacy Admin Channel](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/radio/security/#admin-channel-enabled) enable/disable

### Instructions
The USB drive must be formatted with a single FAT32, exFAT, NTFS (read only - log will not be saved to drive) or ext4 partition. Add a file named `femtofox-config.txt` and whichever settings you would like to change (CaSe sEnSiTiVe).

> Clearing the `meshtastic_admin_key` list: The admin key list can contain up to three keys - *if more are added they will be ignored*. The USB configuration tool supports clearing the admin key list, after which you will need to re-add your admin key/s in a second operation. To clear the admin key list, enter `meshtastic_admin_key="clear"`.

> [!NOTE]
> `dont_run_if_log_exists="true"` will prevent the USB configuration tool from working if there's a log present on the USB drive, indicating it has already been run. There is also an LED boot code for this, described below.

**To apply your configuration, reboot the Femtofox with the USB drive plugged in. No other USB drives can be plugged in at the same time.**
A log (`femtofox-config.log`) is saved to `/home/femto` and the USB drive (except on NTFS, which is read only).

### Boot codes
When the Femtofox is finished booting, it will blink its User LED (see below) in a pattern which can be used to gather info on its status or help diagnose issues.

> [!NOTE]
> Boot codes can appear in sequence - for example: one long (4 second) blink, followed by 5 medium (half second) blinks means the USB drive failed to mount, and that the boot sequence is complete.
